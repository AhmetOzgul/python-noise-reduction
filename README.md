This project implements a real-time audio noise reduction system using Fourier transform analysis. The system captures microphone input, analyzes frequencies using FFT to separate human voice from background noise, and outputs clean audio with minimal delay. It demonstrates practical application of digital signal processing techniques for noise cancellation similar to modern headphones.
